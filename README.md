# flutter_weather_app

A Weather app I created using Flutter

## Things to take note

+ Make sure you properly install flutter to you device, please see [flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) on how to install flutter in different OS devices(Windows, Mac, Linux)
+ run `flutter doctor -v` and make sure all of the requirements are **checked**
+ for you to change the Accuweather API key, please change `\lib\constants\globals.dart` **apikey** variable's value
+ to run the app please use the command `flutter run`, make sure that your Emulator is already open so flutter will automatically select the emulator once you the command
+ to check test, run the command `flutter test`, it should not have any error

## Improvements
**Geolocation**, maybe in the future as I am planning to add this assessment as my portfolio project
